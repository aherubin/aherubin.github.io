# Welcome to Aimee Herubin's website!

<b>About me</b>: 
I have recently submitted my PhD thesis on phonetic variation as a function of sexual orientation in the speech of Rainbow women. Rainbow is a term used in New Zealand to describe members of the LGBTQIA+ community. My research uses a case study format to investigate the extent of speech style shifting in the construction of Rainbow identities by a group of queer women and gender diverse people.
My research interests include theoretical linguistics, sociolingusitics, phonetics and phonology, identity, and gender and sexual orientation
